What's up? Welcome to my first ever webpage that contains everything you need to know about me. As you can tell by the big title up there ^^^ my name is Kyler Vollmar. I'm a first year business student here at UGA. Where I'm from actually isn't too far from here, just an hour. It's called Cumming, GA, or more specifically Forsyth County. I'm an only child, the closest thing I've got to siblings are my 4 pets. Harley the dog, Maddie the obese cat, and Jasey & Zoe, the troublesome sister cats.</p>

<div style="background-color:#AF7AC5">
<p>
<b>Captain D's:</b> This was my first ever job, and ironically, my mom's first job as well-- way back in the day. More ironically, I hate fast food and seafood, so working here wasn't the best. However, I worked here with 5 of my close friends so it was actually a very fun job given how gross it also was. I cleaned the dining room, kitchen-- actually now that I'm thinking about it, I cleaned pretty much everything there. I also worked the drive-thru, register, and made sure all our guests were happy, which wasn't often.
</p>
<p>
<b>North Point Ministries:</b> This wasn't technically an official job since I never got paid, but working at this church did set me up to my next job. For a couple weeks during the summer I helped North Point Church with their production of a show they put on called "Kid's Stuf". It's a really silly show with a lot of whacky characters, but the work I did was very interesting. I would help operate the cameras and arrange the set for the actors. It was a very simple job, but it led me to meet a guy named Michael who would later on take interest in recruiting me for his business.
</p>
<p>
<b>CMS:</b> This is a job I worked last summer and will work again in just a few weeks. It is also the job that Michael hooked me up with! I absolutely love working at CMS, where we rent out camera, sound, and light equipment to venues and events. Often times we even get to operate our own equipment at the venues we rented out to, meaning I have filmed many really sick concerts. This summer Michael is taking me under his wing and teaching me everything he knows about running his own business.
